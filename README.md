# Shortest-Path Visualizer

## Description
This project is a **Shortest Path Visualizer** built using **GurobiPy**, **FastAPI**, and **ReactJS**. It calculates the optimal path on a grid, avoiding user-defined blocked squares, and provides a React-based interface for visualizing the solution.

---

## Features
- Grid-based shortest pathfinding.
- Customizable blocked squares to simulate obstacles.
- Optimal path computation using Gurobi Optimizer.
- RESTful API backend powered by FastAPI.
- Interactive frontend built with ReactJS.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, GurobiPy
- **Frontend**: ReactJS

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Gurobi Optimizer (installed and licensed)
- react.js (for React frontend)
